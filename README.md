# Retrieval-Augmented Generation Implementation in Python

## Overview
This project implements retrieval-augmented generation techniques using Python, primarily within Jupyter Notebooks. These techniques enhance natural language generation by incorporating relevant information retrieved from external sources, improving the quality and relevance of generated text.

## Features
- **Retrieval Mechanism**: Efficient retrieval of relevant information from external datasets.
- **Generation Model**: Advanced natural language generation models leveraging retrieved information.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive and easy-to-follow notebooks demonstrating the implementation and results.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RM-RAMASAMY/retrieval-augmented-generation-implementation-in-python.git
